Work Experience
Machine Learning Team Leader - Israeli Air Force (Nov 2023 - Present)
Leading a team of nine engineers. Designing AI system architectures and hands-on implementation.

Developed real-time drone classification model using a custom cascaded deep CNN model with artificial perturbations to simulate real-world variability - Field used successfully.
Developed an LLM-powered chat-bot using LLaMA and TensorRT. Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for real-time access to proprietary documentation.
Developed "Smart Base" surveillance application featuring people detection, aircraft detection, and number identification OCR, utilizing and fine-tuning YOLOv11 and GOTOCR 2.0.

Machine Learning Team Leader - Israeli Air Force (Dec 2021 - Nov 2023)
Co-founded an AI team to develop rapid AI solutions.

Developed flight route optimization model using Reinforcement-Learning DQN model. Improved average route fuel efficiency by 10% and drastically reduced planning time by 2 hours.
Engineered a remote surveillance system for real-time object detection using AI, developed in C++ on the Jetson Nano. Integrated with satellite communication - successfully delivered within a tight 3-month deadline.
Developed an AI storage layout recommendation and management system for Hercules aircraft, by training reinforcement learning DQN model. Managed to reduce mission planning time by over four hours per operation.

System Engineer - Israeli Air Force (Oct 2019 - Dec 2021)

Led a POC project on RADAR synthetic target injection for testing aircraft weapon systems. Worked independently, self-studying U.S. RADAR signal protocol documentation and implementing core logic in VHDL. The POC was approved, funded and produced to delivery.
